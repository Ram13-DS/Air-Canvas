**Object Detection**
This window shows us whether the object is detecting or not. So that we can know that our object has been detected or not on the black screen the white dot represents the object, based on the movement of object the white dot replicates the detection of object movement and draw or write in the writing module

As mentioned in the algorithm we can change colours in the module, this helps us the manage the colour detection based on user convenience.
